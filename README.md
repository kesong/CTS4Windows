# CTS4Windows
Runnning CTS 7.0 on Windows

Offical CTS could only running on Ubuntu or other Linux Distributions, check the script in the offcial package the CTS console is launched with jar. So I do some adaption to make the scripts could running on windows.

The script is written in python, and it's very convenient to be modified.
